                    There are different types of tests â€“ diagnostic tests and antibody tests.

                      Diagnostic tests can show if you have an active COVID-19 infection and 
                 need to take steps to quarantine or isolate yourself from others. Molecula
                 r and antigen tests are types of diagnostic tests than can detect if you have an active COVID-19 infection. Samples for diagnostic tests are typically collected with a nasal or throat swab, or saliva collected by spitting into a tube.
